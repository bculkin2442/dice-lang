@TODO 10/08/17 Ben Culkin :ModuleSplitting
	Split dice-lang into maven modules. Right now I'm thinking to split it
	into the following modules
	- dice (contains everything in the dice package)
	- SCL  (contains everything in the SCL package)
	- lang (contains everything else)
	This'll make it easier to use these parts elsewhere, as well as make
	compilation times shorter
